    "\n",
    "Description of the data to be used to solve the problem\n",
    "For this project we will use the knowledge acquired in course 9 to use the benefits of the Forsquare API to explore data from both cities and neighborhoods, and data that is relevant for people who travel such as coffee shops, hotels, restaurants that can visit and be close, theaters and many places for which to have a choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also use the data that wikipedia provides about each neighborhood of both cities which can be accessed from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M and https://cocl.us/new_york_dataset. We will combine both sets of data to make clusters according to the characteristics of each neighborhood."
